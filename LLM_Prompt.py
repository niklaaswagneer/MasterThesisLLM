        ### **Context:**
        The following text summarizes the **major and minor order intake changes** across different product lines and regions.
        It also provide how large the change is percieved to be and the reasoning until then.

        ### **Context:**
        We are analyzing order intake changes for a few product lines in our company.

        The dataset consists of:
        - **Product Line**: Represents different product categories at our company. 
        - **Region**: The geographical area where changes occurred.
        - **Total Difference**: The monetary change in order intake.
        - **Product Area Contribution %**: The relative impact of each product line within the company

        ### **Task:**
        1Ô∏è‚É£ **For each row in the dataset, classify it as one of the following:**
        - **Major Increase** ‚Üí A significant positive driver of growth.
        - **Minor Increase** ‚Üí A small but positive change.
        - **Major Decrease** ‚Üí A significant decline impacting the product area.
        - **Minor Decrease** ‚Üí A small but negative change.

        2Ô∏è‚É£ **Summarize each product line into the format:**
        - **[Product Line] in [Region]** is a **[Major/Minor] [Increase/Decrease]**, contributing **X% of product area impact**.

        3Ô∏è‚É£ **Identify key trends across all product lines:**
        - Which **product lines** are driving the most growth?
        - Which **product lines** are responsible for the largest declines?
        - Are changes **consistent across regions**, or do they vary?
