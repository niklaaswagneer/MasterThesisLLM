SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a financial analyst writing a financial report. Your task is to analyze and summarize changes in financial data.

You must write a concise summary in at most 4 sentences to complement the numerical data in a financial report. 
Focus on clear, direct language and only state what is evident in the data â€” no speculation or recommendations. 
Do not include numbers. Focus on trends, main drivers, and regions as specified.
"""


PROMPT_TEMPLATES = {
    "net_sales": """
The data below shows net sales changes segmented by product line and region, with relative contributions to the overall change in a business area.
The overall change is {overall_change}.

Instructions:
- Identify whether the overall trend is an increase or decrease
- Detect the main positive and main negative drivers
- Detect if there are product lines where the direction of change is consistent across all Regions
- Write a concise final qualitative summary about the detected trends
- Start the summary by mentioning the driver that has the biggest overall impact. 

Rules for the final summary
- Maximum of 4 sentences for the summary
- Do not speculate, do not include numbers, only state what the data clearly shows
- Do not include the overall trend in the summary since that is already understood.
- No need to use linking words or similar filling words, use language similar to that in the provided examples.

Expected output examples:
Example 1: All product lines up. [Product Line] in [Region] as main growth driver. [Product Line] increasing in [Region]. Increase from [Product Line] in [Region]. [Product Line] up in all regions.
Example 2: [Product Line] and [Product Line] decreasing in [Region]. [Product Line] in [Region] as main detractor, partly offset by [Product Line] in [Region].
Example 3: [Product Line] in [Region] as main detractor. Increase from [Product Line] in [Region].
Example 4: [Product Line] up in all regions. [Product Line] down in [Region]. [Product line] up in [Region]
